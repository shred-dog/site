        <p>There’s something about standing at the top of the hill (or mountain, or handrail), staring down your run, taking it all in, giving your bindings one last reassuring click, that makes you feel alive. It’s the reason you come back again and again despite cold weather, bumps, and bruises. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Shred Dog exists to connect kids and parents to this feeling. I felt it myself after years of dormancy, when my toddler son strapped into a board for the first time and glided down the bunny hill. Snowboarding gave us a chance to smile and laugh together in ways we never had before. It was electrifying.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Shred Dog is here for this–to give the rising generation its first step into board sports, and to rekindle the magic of standing sideways again for parents.</p>
